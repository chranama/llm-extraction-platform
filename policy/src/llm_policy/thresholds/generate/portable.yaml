# policy/src/llm_policy/thresholds/generate/portable.yaml
# Generate SLO clamp thresholds (portable / demo-friendly profile)
#
# Intended for Mode A (CPU / generate-only):
#   - clamp earlier to keep latency stable
#   - conservative fail-closed cap
#   - fewer steps to keep demo behavior obvious

min_requests: 8

safe_cap_on_invalid_snapshot: 128

error_rate:
  # Slightly more tolerant than default (avoid clamping on transient blips),
  # but still hard clamp if it gets meaningfully bad.
  threshold: 0.03
